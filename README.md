# Whisked Wonders

## Description

Many people around the world have a sweet tooth but sometimes can’t decide either baking at home or finding the nearest location. The website makes this an easier decision by allowing a customer to choose between the two. The website allows the user to browse for different recipes of delicious desserts, in which they can choose to prepare the dessert by themselves. Otherwise, the user has the option to find nearby bakeries around the location that the user choose.

## User story

```
As a dessert enthusiast,
I want to explore a delightful collection of dessert recipes along with suggested drink pairings,
with the option to locate nearby bakeries if I prefer not to bake myself.
