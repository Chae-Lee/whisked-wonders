# Whisked Wonders

## Description

Many people around the world have a sweet tooth but sometimes can’t decide either baking at home or finding the nearest location. The website makes this an easier decision by allowing a customer to choose between the two. The website allows the user to browse for different recipes of delicious desserts, in which they can choose to prepare the dessert by themselves. Otherwise, the user has the option to find nearby bakeries around the location that the user choose.

This is a application that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS that is powered by JavaScript code. 


## User story

As a dessert enthusiast,
